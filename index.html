      <li>1/2 cup marsala</li>
      <li>3 eggs, separated</li>
      <li>1/3 cup caster sugar</li>
      <li>250g mascarpone</li>
      <li>300ml thickened cream, lightly whipped</li>
      <li>1 large packet of sponge finger biscuits</li>
      <li>Cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>

        <li>
          Pour coffee and marsala into a shallow dish or baking dish. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beat egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl with electric beaters until
          pale and thick. Add the mascarpone and whipped cream, mixing gently
          until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beat egg whites in a medium bowl with electric beaters until soft
          peaks form. Using a large metal spoon, gently fold eggwhites into the
          mascarpone mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dip enough sponge finger biscuits into the coffee mixture to cover the
          base of a 19cm square ceramic dish. Cover the biscuits with one-third
          of the mascarpone mixture. Repeat layers 2 times, ending with the
          cream. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for
          <span style="color: green"> at least 2 hours.</span>
          Dust generously with cocoa powder and serve.
        </li>
